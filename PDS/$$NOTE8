Hi Sam,

I hope you're well!

In the meantime RACF change activity has calmed down as expected.
Nonetheless I've now completed two sample jobs (one for VSAM and
one for non-VSAM) to set or clear the RACF indicators of all
datasets, catalogs and VSAM objects in the system in a fully
automated way. Also, Phil recently tested the complete
installation procedure including all PTFs and detected a bug and
several minor issues.

I've combined these sample jobs, some utilities needed to run
them, the fixes for the issues Phil detected and a lot of changes
to the User's Guide into PTF RRKF006, which is attached to this
mail in the usual format (XMITed PDS).

The new User s Guide is packaged inside the PTF the same way as I
did it in RRKF004 (a ZIP file containing it in PDF and in MS-Word
format). I've also attached them separately so that you can
easily replace members RAKFDOC# and RAKFDOC@ in File 850 without
having to unpack the RRKF006E member containing the ZIP file. I
don't think it's worthwhile to update the text format User's
Guide in RAKFDOC that you created after RRKF004, I'd just add a
remark that the PDF and MS-Word versions are more recent.

Thanks again for updating File 850

Best, Juergen
