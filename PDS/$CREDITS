Concerning the credits: Please have a look into relfile
TRKF120.F2 of the attached tape. In the $$$$INFO member I try to
describe the way of the product from ESG to RAKF and in the
$$NOTICE member I added the relevant part of my mail exchange
with Craig. I totally agree with you to give Craig the main
credit but would suggest to add Phil Dickinson and Phil Roberts
to the first sentence of the @FILE850 member as they did major
enabling work to get RAKF going with MVS 3.8j. The exact
contributions are:

-      Phil Dickinson: First idea on how to do it on MVS 3.8j and
        early beta" type of implementation in 2005. Lost his source
       later on.

-      Phil Roberts: Recovery of Phil D's changes to the original
       ESG source through disassembly and compare. Great job!

-      Juergen Winkelmann: Debugging and finalizing Phil D's
       implementation, source cleanup, documentation and SMP
       packaging.

-      Scott Vetter: Testing, recommendations concerning the
       logic flow of the RAKF initialization program, the
       documentation and the SMP packaging. Very useful quality
       and user experience enhancements!
