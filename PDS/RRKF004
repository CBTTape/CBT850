 Summary of Changes:
 -------------------

 + RAKF User's Guide:

   RAKF documention was widespread over 5 SAMPLIB members referencing
   each other: $$$$INST, $$$$CUST, $$$$M38J, $$$$RMVE and $$$$$DOC.
   This documentation had been written at different stages of the
   evolution from the ESG Security System to RAKF and became increasingly
   difficult to read as newer parts often invalidated parts of the
   older documentation. In addition the total amount of documentation
   materials exceeds the size that can be edited with reasonable effort
   in handcrafted text files with fixed length 80 byte records.

   With this PTF the documentation is republished as the "RAKF Version 1
   Release 2 Modifaction 0 User's Guide" which is available in two
   formats:

   o Microsoft Word 2010 .docx:        The source document ("original
                                       copy") and base for further
                                       evolutions.

   o Portable Document Format (PDF/A): Display and printer friendly
                                       format intended for reading or
                                       printing the document using
                                       publicly available no-cost
                                       software (Adobe Acrobat Reader).

   These two formats are made available as member $DOC$ZIP in SAMPLIB
   which is a zip archive containing the two files "Users_Guide.docx"
   and "Users_Guide.pdf". This member is intended to be downloaded in
   binary format to the user's PC using the 3270 terminal emulation's
   file transfer function (typically based on IND$FILE) or any other
   suitable method.

   Once downloaded, the User's Guide can be extracted in the desired
   format (.pdf or .docx) using the PC's standard unzip utility for
   reading or printing using Word, Acrobat Reader or other tools
   compatible with these formats.

   With the installation of this PTF the original documentation members
   $$$$INST, $$$$CUST, $$$$M38J and $$$$RMVE become obsolete and are
   deleted from SAMPLIB. Member $$$$$DOC, which is the original
   documentation of the ESG Security System prepared by Sam Golob in
   1991, is retained in SAMPLIB as a historical reference.

 Special Installation Instructions:
 ----------------------------------

 1. This PTF modifies elements that are not provided inline. These
    elements will be read during APPLY and ACCEPT processing from
    a PDS pointed to by ddname DOCLIB. File RRKF004.doclib.zip
    contains this PDS in XMIT370 format. Before the PTF can be APPLIed
    or ACCEPTed the PDS needs to be RECEIVed with an arbitrary name and
    a //DOCLIB DD DSN=.... statement pointing to the PDS needs to
    be added to the SMP jobs used for APPLYing or ACCEPTing PTFs. After
    the PTF has been APPLIed (and ACCEPTed if desired) the PDS can be
    deleted and the //DOCLIB DD statement can be removed from the
    SMP jobs.

    The following steps can be used to RECEIVE the PDS from file
    RRKF004.doclib.zip:

    o Unzip RRKF004.doclib.xmi from RRKF004.doclib.zip and upload
      it to dataset RAKF.RRKF004.DOCLIB.XMI (LRECL=80,RECFM=FB) on
      your MVS system using your standard unzip utility and upload
      software (use binary mode for upload!)

    o Submit the following job (requires the RECV370 utility to be
      installed, of course):

      //RCVDOCS  JOB ...
      //RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370
      //RECVLOG   DD SYSOUT=*
      //XMITIN    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF004.DOCLIB.XMI,DISP=SHR
      //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1    DD DSN=&&SYSUT1,
      //             UNIT=SYSDA,
      //             SPACE=(CYL,(10,5)),
      //             DISP=(,DELETE,DELETE)
      //SYSUT2    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF004.DOCLIB,
      //             DISP=(,CATLG),SPACE=(TRK,(30,15,1),RLSE),
      //             DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=5600,RECFM=FB),
      //             UNIT=SYSDA
      //SYSIN     DD DUMMY
      //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*

    The dataset names used in this example can be changed to anything
    you like as long as the //DOCLIB DD statement in the SMP APPLY
    and ACCEPT jobs points to the dataset created by //SYSUT2 DD of
    the RCVDOCS job.

 2. RECEIVE, APPLY and ACCEPT the PTF as usual.
