Installation note for PTF RRKF004:
----------------------------------

The cover letter of RRKF004 contains special installation instructions.
Step 1 of these instructions refers to file RRKF004.doclib.zip containing
elements needed for installation. The wording in step 1 concerning this
zip file was based on a different distribution technique. For the CBT tape
distribution perform step 1 as outlined here and continue then with the
usual RECEIVE, APPLY, ACCEPT procedure to install the PTF.

 1. This PTF modifies elements that are not provided inline. These
    elements will be read during APPLY and ACCEPT processing from
    a PDS pointed to by ddname DOCLIB. Member RRKF004E of CBT file 850
    contains this PDS in XMIT370 format. Before the PTF can be APPLIed
    or ACCEPTed the PDS needs to be RECEIVed with an arbitrary name and
    a //DOCLIB DD DSN=.... statement pointing to the PDS needs to
    be added to the SMP jobs used for APPLYing or ACCEPTing PTFs. After
    the PTF has been APPLIed (and ACCEPTed if desired) the PDS can be
    deleted and the //DOCLIB DD statement can be removed from the
    SMP jobs.

    Submit the following job (requires the RECV370 utility to be
    installed, of course) to receive the PDS:

    //RCVELEMS JOB ...
    //RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370
    //RECVLOG   DD SYSOUT=*
    //XMITIN    DD DSN=NAME.OF.YOUR.FILE850.PDS(RRKF004E),DISP=SHR
    //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
    //SYSUT1    DD DSN=&&SYSUT1,
    //             UNIT=SYSDA,
    //             SPACE=(CYL,(10,5)),
    //             DISP=(,DELETE,DELETE)
    //SYSUT2    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF004.DOCLIB,
    //             DISP=(,CATLG),SPACE=(TRK,(30,15,1),RLSE),
    //             DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=5600,RECFM=FB),
    //             UNIT=SYSDA
    //SYSIN     DD DUMMY
    //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*

    The dataset name RAKF.RRKF004.DOCLIB in //SYSUT2 DD can be changed
    to anything you like as long as the //DOCLIB DD statement in the
    SMP APPLY and ACCEPT job points to this dataset.
