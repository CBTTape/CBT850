Phil's mailings from tonight convinced me to produce a final
finaL finAL fiNAL fINAL FINAL product tape J which is attached
here. Please replace all tapes sent out previously by this one!

The only change to last night's tape is the documentation in
SAMPLIB member $$$$M38J:

Yes, I didn't put enough emphasis on outlining when the MVS ZAPs
should be used and when not, so I

·    1. introduced a more detailed section on the consequences of
        applying the ZAPs

·    2. mentioned the orphaned VSAM dataspaces as an example for
        the risk when simply running with the ZAPs and not
        considering them only as a transition help to a fully
        indicated system

·    3. mentioned your workaround using CDSCB instead of a sample
        DSCB ZAP job, as this is basically the same but with much
        lower risk

·    4. introduced a table showing the different
        protection/reliability aspects for indicated/not
        indicated object in ZAPed vs. not ZAPed, fully indicated
        vs. mixed environments, which should show any user
        clearly the way to go.

What I didn't do is putting the DANGER DANGER banner in $$$$M38J:
Simply because doing it wrong with the ZAPs isn't dangerous  it
only yields annoying effects but doesn't harm the system (of
course a user exploiting a security hole caused by such an effect
could then harm the system but that I really don't consider to be
our problem given the lots of warnings I now wrote on this). So
I'd like to use the DANGER DANGER banner only where it's really
dangerous and that's in the RAKF removal section.

So be it then, we're done for now!

Cheers, Juergen

Hi Juergen, all

"If we continue to change small details of the distribution like
during the past two weeks, I fear we'll never get it out "

"Just let me know of any objections against publishing this
version now  If you're fine, I'm going to put it in the RAKF
folder on H390-MVS and suggest that Sam goes forward to put it on
the CBT tape using packaging method he already proposed for the
previous distribution tape."

I have tinkered some and have a work around for the situation
where a VSAM dataset may get orphaned due to a mixed environment.
It doesn't take any outside utilities and can probably be posted
in the forum as/if the issue arises.

Basically if a VSAM cluster is deleted while running with the
MVSZAPs ( not recommened operation but perhaps necessary for some
) one can:

delete hlq.vsam.name noscr
cdscb hlq.vsam.name.data dsorg(ps) vol(xxxxxx) racf
cdscb hlq.vsam.name.index dsorg(ps) vol(xxxxxx) racf
rpf 3.4 with hlq and vol xxxxxx to C catalog then D to delete from pack

Don't think we have a scratch only TSO CP althought IDCAMS might
have a command combination so cataloging wouldn't be needed to
delete from VTOC.

Just can't remember too much any more right now, but think the
above got a clobbered VSAM dataset cleared off the system.

So no, there aren't any objections to release.  Just trying to
anticipate and prepare for some possible issues.

Phil
