Hi Sam,

So, I'll follow up as soon as I've finalized it.  I think I'm
then going to publish it as a PTF to RAKF, as I see it as a RAKF
component.

In the meantime I've finalized the utility and attached it here
as PTF RRKF005.  The packaging is the same as RRKF002 again, three
members for File 850.

As I mentioned last week, this one really is the last "high
priority" PTF.  So, I'm now going to create further updates only
if there are coming up real requirements from people using it or
at least intending to use it.  In the beginning of the project
there was quite a bit of feedback in the H390-MVS Yahoo group but
now it's completely quiet, so I think there is not much need for
further enhancements.

Btw.:  I had a few mail exchanges with Dan concerning the RACIND
utility and he pointed me to CBT File 452, which contains besides
lots of other stuff some macros he wrote to create various forms
of the SVC 26 (CTGPL) parameter lists.  These macros for sure are
very useful for people trying to understand this stuff and code
programs against this interface, as these are exactly the
examples one needs to quickly get to practice after having read
Peter's paper.  But by now it's not possible for people searching
for information to find these macros, because they aren't
mentioned anywhere.  Dan wrote, that he will put some information
in the header member of File 452.  I think, in addition it would
be a good idea to put a pointer into File 689 (Peter's paper)
mentioning Dan's macros in File 452, because Peter's paper
probably is the first useful bit of information one finds when
googling for SVC 26 and CTGPL.

Thanks again and all the best!

Cheers, Juergen
