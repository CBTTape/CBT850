Hi Sam,

Thanks for the packaging proposal. I like it very much because of
its independency from the way users might wish to download/install.

Please note, however, that the distribution is not yet finalized.
From my point of view it is important to have the same version on
CBT than the one we make available to the H390-MVS Yahoo group
where 6 years ago a first binary RAKF version had been published
by Phil Dickinson. I've attached a newer version of the AWS tape
than the one Scott mailed to you. It is almost final, but it
might still happen that the SMP definitions in File 1 get
augmented by a PREreq depending on Scott's findings concerning
the SMP service level of his system. So I'd appreciate if you
replaced the version you've uploaded to the Updates page by the
version attached here  and, if the PREreq mentioned becomes
necessary, in a few days by the final one.

Concerning the credits: Please have a look into relfile
TRKF120.F2 of the attached tape. In the $$$$INFO member I try to
describe the way of the product from ESG to RAKF and in the
$$NOTICE member I added the relevant part of my mail exchange
with Craig. I totally agree with you to give Craig the main
credit but would suggest to add Phil Dickinson and Phil Roberts
to the first sentence of the @FILE850 member as they did major
enabling work to get RAKF going with MVS 3.8j. The exact
contributions are:

-      Phil Dickinson: First idea on how to do it on MVS 3.8j and
        early beta" type of implementation in 2005. Lost his source
       later on.

-      Phil Roberts: Recovery of Phil D's changes to the original
       ESG source through disassembly and compare. Great job!

-      Juergen Winkelmann: Debugging and finalizing Phil D's
       implementation, source cleanup, documentation and SMP
       packaging.

-      Scott Vetter: Testing, recommendations concerning the
       logic flow of the RAKF initialization program, the
       documentation and the SMP packaging. Very useful quality
       and user experience enhancements!

Best, Juergen
