Hi Sam,

Just an additional remark: Assuming you've an archive of
background information on the files on CBT I've attached a job
stream which accomplishes the complete source update from ESG to
RAKF for documentation purposes. It only needs the original CBT
File 165 PDS (named MVS.RAKF.ESG2RAKF.CBT.F165 here, but can be
changed to anything of course). Result is PDS
MVS.RAKF.ESG2RAKF.SRC, which contains the new source (making up
relfile TRKF120.F4 after resequencing) and the original copyright
files (becoming part of relfile TRKF120.F2 with a modification to
$$NOTICE concerning Craig's consent).

The last 3 sequence number digits of the source created using
this job show the origin of the respective modification:

-      380: Modification introduced by Phil D or Phil R

-      381: Basic fixes from me correcting the most obvious
            problems

-      382: Final fixes and new source members from me introduced
            after more detailed analysis. Some of the 382
            additions may make some 380's obsolete but I didn't
            have time to test that in detail and just left the
            380's in.

So, if you've a place to store it, it's fine (don't think it's
worth publishing it, as this would probably only cause
confusion). If not  just discard it.

Best, Juergen
