This note has to do with a problem in reading the RAKFDOC@ member
in MS Word.  Since the original Word document was FTP-ed to an
FB-80 file on MVS, it was padded with blanks at the end.  When
you download the RAKFDOC@ member back to the PC, Word complains
that there is damage to the file and it can't open it.  Then it
asks you if you want to fix the file, and if you say yes, Word
will then fix the file and open it.

This note is for the purpose of telling you that it is OK to
open the RAKFDOC@ document after going through all this trouble.

Hi Sam,

The problem with the MS-Word document is caused by the padding
bytes that fill the last  record" of the RAKFDOC@ member to 80
characters:

Downloading SAMPLIB member $DOC$ZIP to the PC and extracting
Users_Guide.docx from that zip archive yields exactly the same
file, i.e. it compares identically with the original Word
document.

The original Word document has a size of 64,971 bytes.
Downloading member RAKFDOC@ from File 850 results in a file size
of 65,040 bytes (the next multiple of 80). If I manually cut this
file to its first 64,971 bytes it compares identically with the
original document:

------------------------------------------------------------------
C:\Users\juergen\Desktop>dir *.docx
05.05.2011  09:14            65'040 rakfdoc@.docx
05.05.2011  09:25            64'971 rakfdoc@_cut.docx
03.05.2011  09:03            64'971 Users_Guide.docx
C:\Users\juergen\Desktop>comp Users_Guide.docx rakfdoc@.docx
Vergleichen von Users_Guide.docx und rakfdoc@.docx...
Dateien sind unterschiedlich gross.
C:\Users\juergen\Desktop>comp Users_Guide.docx rakfdoc@_cut.docx
Vergleichen von Users_Guide.docx und rakfdoc@_cut.docx...
Dateien sind identisch     (Data is identical)
------------------------------------------------------------------

As the cut file is identical to the original Word document it of
course opens flawlessly in Word.

So, the original Word document is either 11 bytes too long or 69
bytes too short to fit for raw packaging in File 850 without
upsetting MS-Word.

At the moment I don't have a good idea on how to get the original
Word document's size to be a multiple of 80 bytes. The .docx
format in itself is a zip archive (just open it with your zip
utility and you'll see that it contains about 20 xml files), so
just adding a few blanks at the end of the document will not help
as they will be compressed out when MS-Word creates the zip
archive.

Probably it will be best to leave it as it is and perhaps place a
remark in @FILE850 that MS-Word is expected to give error
messages when opening the document and that these should be
ignored.

Best, Juergen
