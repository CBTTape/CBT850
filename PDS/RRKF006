 Summary of Changes:
 -------------------

 + Sample jobs to RACF indicate or unindicate the whole system

   These jobs provide a fully automated way to set or clear the RACF
   indicators of all eligible datasets, VSAM objects and catalogs in
   the system.

 + OCO distribution of RAKF-external utilities

   The sample jobs for RACF indication or unindication need some
   utilities from other sources than RAKF. To ease installation of
   these utilities they are collected to an XMI file containing the
   modules needed and a sample job to install them from this XMI file
   is provided. The User's Guide describes the procedure to install
   these utilities as well as the original source from which they
   were derived.

 + Sample jobs for creation of SYS1.SECURE.CNTL and SYS1.SECURE.PWUP

   These jobs are provided to help with the initial customization
   tasks on systems not having interactive dataset allocation and
   or move/copy utilities available.

 + add missing //RAKFPWUP DD statement to the RAKF cataloged procedure

 + update the RAKF User's Guide with changes introduced since RRKF004

 Special Installation Instructions:
 ----------------------------------

 1. Due to the large amount of new sample and documentation material
    the space allocation of hlq.SAMPLIB and hlq.ASAMPLIB needs to be
    enlarged to avoid space related abends during installation of this
    PTF. Please reallocate these libraries to meet the following
    definitions (calculation based on 3350 type DASD):

    //ASAMPLIB DD  DISP=(,CATLG),DSN=hlq.ASAMPLIB,VOL=SER=dddddd,
    //             UNIT=SYSDA,DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=19040),
    //             SPACE=(TRK,(120,40,10))
    //SAMPLIB  DD  DISP=(,CATLG),DSN=hlq.SAMPLIB,VOL=SER=ssssss,
    //             UNIT=SYSDA,DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=19040),
    //             SPACE=(TRK,(120,40,10))

    Of course, the original contents needs to be copied into the
    newly allocated libraries!

 2. This PTF adds elements that are not provided inline. These
    elements will be read during APPLY and ACCEPT processing from
    a PDS pointed to by ddname RRKF006E. File RRKF006E.zip
    contains this PDS in XMIT370 format. Before the PTF can be APPLIed
    or ACCEPTed the PDS needs to be RECEIVed with an arbitrary name and
    an //RRKF006E DD DSN=.... statement pointing to the PDS needs to
    be added to the SMP jobs used for APPLYing or ACCEPTing PTFs. After
    the PTF has been APPLIed (and ACCEPTed if desired) the PDS can be
    deleted and the //RRKF006E DD statement can be removed from the
    SMP jobs.

    The following steps can be used to RECEIVE the PDS from file
    RRKF006E.zip:

    o Unzip RRKF006E.XMI from RRKF006E.zip and upload
      it to dataset RAKF.RRKF006E.XMI (LRECL=80,RECFM=FB) on
      your MVS system using your standard unzip utility and upload
      software.

    o Submit the following job (requires the RECV370 utility to be
      installed, of course):

      //RCVTLIB  JOB ...
      //RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370
      //RECVLOG   DD SYSOUT=*
      //XMITIN    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF006E.XMI,DISP=SHR
      //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1    DD DSN=&&SYSUT1,
      //             UNIT=SYSDA,
      //             SPACE=(CYL,(10,5)),
      //             DISP=(,DELETE,DELETE)
      //SYSUT2    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF006E,
      //             DISP=(,CATLG),SPACE=(TRK,(6,3,1),RLSE),
      //             DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=5600,RECFM=FB),
      //             UNIT=SYSDA
      //SYSIN     DD DUMMY
      //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*

    The dataset names used in this example can be changed to anything
    you like as long as the //RRKF006E DD statement in the SMP APPLY
    and ACCEPT jobs points to the dataset created by //SYSUT2 DD of
    the RCVTLIB job.

 3. RECEIVE and APPLY the PTF as usual.

 4. ACCEPT the PTF according to your preferences after sufficient
    testing.
