Hi Sam,

Back from Easter holidays I couldn't resist solving this pending
RAKF password change issue... the evolution was:

·       The ESG Security System ignored the NEWPASS parameter of
        RACINIT completely.

·       The first RAKF implementation from 2005 updated the
        in-core UDATA table with the new password which provided
        an almost usable functionality in that it enabled users to
        change their password but the change lived only as long as
        the in-core UDATA table didn't get rebuilt from source.
        So, at the latest with the next IPL, all passwords changed
        by users through their application using RACINIT NEWPASS=
        were reverted to the ones coded in the source users table.

·       With the change I've now published as PTF RRKF002 the new
        password is not only updated to the in-core UDATA table
        but also to the source table through a queuing mechanism.
        This, finally, provides a fully functional RACINIT NEWPASS
        handling conforming to the specifications defined by
        RACF.

PTF RRKF002 wasn't fully packagable inline, I need a TXLIB to
provide some of the elements (to be exact: Sample job ZJW0003
from SAMPLIB which modifies MSTRJCL to add some DD statements is
the culprit  as it is a USERMOD it contains MCS statements that
would intermix with the PTF's MCS statements with inline
packaging).  So, the attached file RRKF002.zip contains an XMITted
PDS with 3 members:

*       RRKF002: The PTF
*       RRKF002E: The TXLIB in XMITted format
*       RRKF002I: Instructions on making the TXLIB available for
                  APPLY/ACCEPT

I think, you could just copy the 3 members to File 850. This
would comply with your convention to add PTFs just with their
member name and the two additional members are close enough in
the member list to be easily spotted if one wants to install the
PTF.

Thanks again!

Best, Juergen

P.S.: With this change the original $$$$$DOC member you prepared
in 1991 would be really due for an update. Up to now I left it
completely untouched for nostalgic reasons and just referred in
the other documentation members on which information is no longer
valid in $$$$$DOC. This is (just a probably incomplete quick
shot) the installation procedure, the startup and customization
considerations, the password change feature, the names of the
tables and cataloged procedures  huuuhhh, I'd probably need a
volunteer J
