Hi Sam,

Thanks for the background info concerning how the documentation
was written. Of course I had no idea under which circumstances
your documentation was written (I assumed you had some sort of
cooperation with Craig's company ESG back then). For Europeans it
is beyond imagination that an employer can kick you out from one
day to the next, although we of course know that it is done often
like this in the US. You did a great job back then preparing it
for use and writing that documentation!

Back in 1991 I didn't know of the existence of the ESG Security
System but I wish I had. At that time I ran three IBM hosts at
ETH, one of which was an IBM 3090-600J-6VF (6 CPUs, each one
equipped with a Vector Feature). This was the biggest iron sold
by IBM at that time. Our use case for that system was scientific
computing (of course), so we would have been perfectly happy with
a security solution a the level of the ESG Security System. If I
imagine now, how much licensing fees for that incredibly
expensive RACF we could have saved.

Anyway now it's 20 years later and we're doing it just for fun J

I've attached the documentation PTF RRKF004 to this mail. It is
in the same format as RRKF002 was, i.e. an XMITed PDS with three
members that you can incorporate directly into File 850:

*       RRKF004:    The PTF
*       RRKF004E:   A PDF in XMITted format to be used by SMP as
                    TXLIB
*       RRKF004I:   Instructions on making the TXLIB available
                    for APPLY/ACCEPT

The PTF simply replaces the obsolete documentation members
($$$$INST, $$$$CUST, $$$$M38J, $$$$RMVE) in SAMPLIB with a new
one named $DOC$ZIP which is a zip archive containing the User's
Guide as a PDF file and the  source" Word document from which the
PDF was created. SAMPLIB member $$$$INFO, which previously
pointed the user to the four now deleted document members and to
your $$$$$DOC, has been changed to point to the $DOC$ZIP file
with an instruction on how to use it and to your $$$$$DOC member
as a historic reference.

Thanks again for all your help. It's a real pleasure working with
you at this stuff.

Best, Juergen
