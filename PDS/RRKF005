 Summary of Changes:
 -------------------

 + RACIND Utility to control VSAM RACF Indicators

   This PTF adds a new utility named RACIND to RAKF. RACIND allows
   to switch the RACF indicator of any VSAM catalog entry on or off,
   thus enabling easy indication and unindication of the system's VSAM
   catalogs and objects.

   SAMPLIB member RACIND is a sample job stream illustrating the use
   of the RACIND utility.

 Special Installation Instructions:
 ----------------------------------

 1. This PTF adds elements that are not provided inline. These
    elements will be read during APPLY and ACCEPT processing from
    a PDS pointed to by ddname RACIND. File RRKF005.racind.zip
    contains this PDS in XMIT370 format. Before the PTF can be APPLIed
    or ACCEPTed the PDS needs to be RECEIVed with an arbitrary name and
    a //RACIND DD DSN=.... statement pointing to the PDS needs to
    be added to the SMP jobs used for APPLYing or ACCEPTing PTFs. After
    the PTF has been APPLIed (and ACCEPTed if desired) the PDS can be
    deleted and the //RACIND DD statement can be removed from the
    SMP jobs.

    The following steps can be used to RECEIVE the PDS from file
    RRKF005.racind.zip:

    o Unzip RRKF005.RACIND.XMI from RRKF005.racind.zip and upload
      it to dataset RAKF.RRKF005.RACIND.XMI (LRECL=80,RECFM=FB) on
      your MVS system using your standard unzip utility and upload
      software.

    o Submit the following job (requires the RECV370 utility to be
      installed, of course):

      //RCVIND   JOB ...
      //RECV370  EXEC PGM=RECV370
      //RECVLOG   DD SYSOUT=*
      //XMITIN    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF005.RACIND.XMI,DISP=SHR
      //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1    DD DSN=&&SYSUT1,
      //             UNIT=SYSDA,
      //             SPACE=(CYL,(10,5)),
      //             DISP=(,DELETE,DELETE)
      //SYSUT2    DD DSN=RAKF.RRKF005.RACIND,
      //             DISP=(,CATLG),SPACE=(TRK,(6,3,1),RLSE),
      //             DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=5600,RECFM=FB),
      //             UNIT=SYSDA
      //SYSIN     DD DUMMY
      //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*

    The dataset names used in this example can be changed to anything
    you like as long as the //RACIND DD statement in the SMP APPLY
    and ACCEPT jobs points to the dataset created by //SYSUT2 DD of
    the RCVIND job.

 2. RECEIVE and APPLY the PTF as usual.

 3. ACCEPT the PTF according to your preferences after sufficient
    testing.

//RACIND   JOB
//********************************************************************
//*
//* Name: RACIND
//*
//* Desc: Run RACIND Utility
//*
//* FUNTION: Act upon control statements read from SYSIN to set or
//*          clear the RACF indicator of VSAM catalog entries. The
//*          following control statements are valid:
//*
//*          ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+
//*          CATALOG   name of catalog to search for entries
//*          RACON     name of entry to indicate
//*          RACOFF    name of entry to unindicate
//*          * Comment
//*
//*          Any number of control statements is allowed. The first
//*          none comment statement must be a CATALOG statement. A
//*          CATALOG statement remains active until a new CATALOG
//*          statement replaces it.
//*

**********************************************************************
*
* Example: Switch on the RACF indicator for a VSAM catalog
*          and a cluster contained in that catalog.
*
* Note:    - The data and index components of a VSAM catalog
*            MUST NOT be RACF indicated.
*
*          - All other entry types MUST have either all of their
*            components RACF indicated or all components not
*            indicated.
*
*          For that reason in the example only one RACON statement
*          is coded for the catalog, but three for the cluster.
