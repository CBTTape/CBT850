This is still a work in progress. 
Due to amazing work by Alison Zhang and Jake Choi repos are no longer deleted.

//***FILE 850 is from Juergen Winkelmann, based on the pioneering   *   FILE 850
//*           and expert work of Craig Yasuna.  This is Craig's     *   FILE 850
//*           ESG security system adapted for MVS 3.8J that is run  *   FILE 850
//*           under Hercules, and is called RAKF.                   *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           Credit for the modifications goes to Phil Dickinson,  *   FILE 850
//*           Phil Roberts, Juergen Winkelmann, and Scott Vetter.   *   FILE 850
//*           See member $CREDITS in this file for details.         *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           For the record, to see the modifications from the ESG *   FILE 850
//*           security system thru (some level of) this source code *   FILE 850
//*           please see member ESG2RAKF.                           *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           The product is packaged as an SMP install for MVS 3.8 *   FILE 850
//*           as a "tape" file in AWS format.  This "tape" has been *   FILE 850
//*           folded into FB-80 and is included in this file as     *   FILE 850
//*           member AWSTAPE.  A "real tape" can be made from this  *   FILE 850
//*           member, using the VTT2TAPE program from CBT File 533  *   FILE 850
//*           whose source (in RECV370 format) is in member VASM.   *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           However, if you already have a Hercules system, you   *   FILE 850
//*           can just FTP the AWSTAPE member to a PC file, or      *   FILE 850
//*           download it to there using the IND$FILE program, and  *   FILE 850
//*           mount it as a tape under Hercules using the devinit   *   FILE 850
//*           command on the Hercules console.                      *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           PTFs are listed here under their sysmod name.         *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           Example:  RRKF001                                     *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*           However, for those who do not want to use the "tape"  *   FILE 850
//*           to install RAKF, each relfile has been expanded into  *   FILE 850
//*           a member of this file, that can be made into a pds    *   FILE 850
//*           using the PDSLOAD program (whose source code is also  *   FILE 850
//*           packaged in the VASM member).  To my knowledge, both  *   FILE 850
//*           programs (PDSLOAD and this version of VTT2TAPE) can   *   FILE 850
//*           be run on MVS 3.8.                                    *   FILE 850
//*                                                                 *   FILE 850
//*       PTFs were added to this package, and will be added as     *   FILE 850
//*       needed:                                                   *   FILE 850
